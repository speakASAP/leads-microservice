## Current State

- Stage: production.
- Health: `ok` after Goal 10 deployment.
- Current owner-selected task: Goal 20 - Auth Workspace-Scoped Admin Isolation is complete and deployed.
- Runtime source changes in the latest completed runtime task: Auth-backed admin guard now captures workspace/tenant claims, admin APIs pass admin scope into service reads, and Leads applies LEADS_ADMIN_WORKSPACE_SOURCE_MAP to non-global admin summary/list/detail reads.
- Latest implementation change: Goal 20 adds fail-closed workspace-scoped admin isolation for non-global Auth admins while keeping global:superadmin platform-wide.
- Deployment: completed after owner approval. Goal 18 migration applied in the restarted pod; health and admin 401 smoke checks passed.

## Preserved Intent Summary

Leads is the consent-aware intake service for non-registered contact submissions. It must preserve contact, source, message, consent, confirmation, preference, and unsubscribe evidence while avoiding raw lead data export, mass outreach without human review, and ownership drift into Auth, Notifications, Marketing, Logging, database infrastructure, or AI model ownership.

## Next Recommended Goal

Next recommended implementation goal: configure real LEADS_ADMIN_WORKSPACE_SOURCE_MAP entries once Auth workspace IDs are available, or select the next owner-approved Leads runtime slice.

## Known Blockers

- None.

## Continuation Instructions

1. Re-read `docs/orchestrator/STATUS.md`.
2. Select the next owner-approved implementation goal or deployment action and create/update goal-specific artifacts before source edits.
3. Preserve service boundaries: Leads owns non-registered intake/consent/preferences/unsubscribe; Auth owns identity/RBAC/tenancy; Marketing owns campaigns; Notifications owns delivery; CRM owns funnel workflow once implemented.
4. Do not implement raw lead export, mass outreach, campaign execution, AI enrichment, or production lead mutation without explicit owner approval and validation evidence.
5. Record validation and continuation evidence before ending.
