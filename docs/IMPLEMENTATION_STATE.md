## Current State

- Stage: production.
- Health: `ok` after Goal 10 deployment.
- Current owner-selected task: Goal 18 - Durable Lifecycle Event Storage is complete.
- Runtime source changes in the latest completed runtime task: durable minimized lifecycle event table/migration, idempotent lifecycle router persistence, guarded one-lead lifecycle event retrieval, and focused tests.
- Latest implementation change: Goal 18 durably persists minimized lifecycle events and exposes guarded one-lead lifecycle event retrieval without raw lead export.
- Deployment: not performed for Goal 18; migration/deploy requires owner approval. Public response shapes, notification dispatch, campaign execution behavior, and external service ownership are unchanged.

## Preserved Intent Summary

Leads is the consent-aware intake service for non-registered contact submissions. It must preserve contact, source, message, consent, confirmation, preference, and unsubscribe evidence while avoiding raw lead data export, mass outreach without human review, and ownership drift into Auth, Notifications, Marketing, Logging, database infrastructure, or AI model ownership.

## Active Goal

Goal 18 - Durable Lifecycle Event Storage is complete. Focused tests, full tests, Prisma generation/validation, build, lint, and documentation scans passed.

## Next Recommended Goal

Next recommended implementation goal: deploy/apply the Goal 18 migration when owner approval is given, or select Auth-backed admin authentication after exact Auth claim names and tenant mapping semantics are confirmed.

## Known Blockers

- None.

## Continuation Instructions

1. Re-read `docs/orchestrator/STATUS.md`.
2. Select the next owner-approved implementation goal or deployment action and create/update goal-specific artifacts before source edits.
3. Preserve service boundaries: Leads owns non-registered intake/consent/preferences/unsubscribe; Auth owns identity/RBAC/tenancy; Marketing owns campaigns; Notifications owns delivery; CRM owns funnel workflow once implemented.
4. Do not implement raw lead export, mass outreach, campaign execution, AI enrichment, or production lead mutation without explicit owner approval and validation evidence.
5. Record validation and continuation evidence before ending.
